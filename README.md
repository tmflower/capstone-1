## General Information
-  Word Nerdz is a game in which users are challenged to earn points by guessing a mystery word within 60 seconds, given limited hints about the word. Users may get additional hints at the cost of points from their potential winnings. Logged in users may complete for a spot among the top 5 highest scoring players, which is updated and displayed at the end of each round played. Logged in users will also have their played words automatically saved, along with all information available about each word. They may curate this selection of words by deleting words or adding new words using the basic word lookup feature. Users who are not logged in may play the game and look up words, but will not have their cumulative points or words saved and displayed.
