        <li>Your goal: Score maximum points by guessing the mystery word within 60 seconds while using the fewest number of hints.</li>
        <li>Your reward: Ranking on the leaderboard and bragging rights as the nerdiest of the Werd Nerdz!<br>(If you're logged in <em>and</em> are among the top 5 highest-scoring players)</li>
        <li>You may guess as many times as you want to without a penalty.</li>
        <li>You'll start with 100 points and a few freebie hints about the mystery word. Points will be deducted as you use additional hints:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>1st hint: 50 points deducted</li>
            <li>2nd hint: 25 more points deducted</li>
            <li>3rd hint: 15 more points deducted</li>
